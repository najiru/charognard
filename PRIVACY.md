# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** December 2025

## Overview

Charognard for Instagram is a browser extension that helps users discover and manage Instagram accounts. Your privacy is important to us.

## Data Collection

### What we collect

The extension stores the following data **locally on your device**:

- **Followed profiles**: Username, profile picture URL, and timestamp of when you followed them
- **Daily action counts**: Number of follows/unfollows performed today
- **User preferences**: Daily limits and automation settings
- **Onboarding status**: Whether you've completed the initial setup

### What we do NOT collect

- We do **not** collect your Instagram password
- We do **not** send any data to external servers
- We do **not** track your browsing activity
- We do **not** use analytics or tracking scripts
- We do **not** share any data with third parties

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally using your browser's storage API (`browser.storage.local`). Data is scoped per Instagram account, meaning each Instagram account you use has its own separate data.

## Data Access

The extension only accesses Instagram's website (`instagram.com`) to:

- Display suggested accounts from Instagram's discovery feature
- Perform follow/unfollow actions on your behalf
- Check follow-back status of accounts you've followed

All API calls use your existing Instagram session - we never ask for or store your login credentials.

## Data Deletion

You can delete all extension data at any time by:

1. Removing the extension from your browser
2. Or clearing your browser's extension storage

## Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review the entire codebase at:
